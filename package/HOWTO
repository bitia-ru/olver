Instructions on how to build the source and binary packages for the LSB OLVER test suite.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prerequisites:

- LSB bzr 1.0 or later
- GNU build tools: gcc, gcc-c++, m4, make autoconf, automake
- libstdc++-devel
- libtool
- Java SDK Runtime Enviroment 1.5 or later
- ncurses-devel
- LSB-SDK 3.1 or later
- LSB dynamic linker is in proper place (/%_lib/ld-lsb-%_arch.so.3)
- LSB RPM Build Tool 0.5 or later

All build work should be done as an "ordinary" user, rather than root.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Steps:

1. Checkout the branch for test suite from Bazaar repository.

Initial checkout may take some minutes to complete:

	$> bzr branch http://bzr.linux-foundation.org/lsb/devel/olver-core-tests

or if you have existing branches, say, in /home/tester/temp:
    
    $> cd /home/tester/temp/olver-core-tests
    $> bzr pull

2. Building the tarball and package.

To build package just use a plain "make". The Makefile accepts the environment variable BZRTREES to pull from your local branches to build the tarball, rather than the remote ones.

	$> cd ./package
	$> BZRTREES=/home/tester/temp make

To build source tarball use "make tarball".

	$> cd ./package
	$> BZRTREES=/home/tester/temp make tarball

You should find something like this at the end of the build in the current directory: 

    lsb-test-olver-core-<version>-<revision>.<architecture>.rpm
    lsb-test-olver-core-<version>-<revision>.src.tgz
